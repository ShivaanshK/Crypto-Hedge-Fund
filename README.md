Given a Polygon network wallet address:

0x008062acA356B5F93F2F14b71Fd73db91A606d0C


…and a list of tokens on the Polygon network:

SHI3LD 0xf239e69ce434c7fb408b05a0da416b14917d934e

KOGE 0x13748d548D95D78a3c83fe3F32604B4796CFfa23

PEAR 0xc8bcb58caEf1bE972C0B638B1dD8B0748Fdc8A44

SING 0xCB898b0eFb084Df14dd8E018dA37B4d0f06aB26D 


Your task is to first investigate how to retrieve the wallet’s token balances by calling/interacting with smart contracts in any programming language of your choice. Note that you must directly interact with smart contracts instead of relying on a 3rd party API such as Moralis to retrieve the balances.


Once you have the token balances, you are to find out the maximum total value of the tokens in DAI (0x8f3cf7ad23cd3cadbd9735aff958023239c6a063) if they can be swapped through the following exchanges: 1inch (https://1inch.io/), Apeswap (https://apeswap.finance/), and Cafeswap (https://cafeswap.finance/). You'll want to consider which exchange gives the best exchange rate. Note the maximum value of each token and the exchange that gives the best rate.
